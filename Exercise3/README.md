# Exercise 3 (Week 4: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks)

This exercise implements one-vs-all logistic regression and a basic neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
We train using 5000 training examples (each 20x20 grayscale images) from the MNIST dataset.

* The multi-class classification solution calculates 10 sets of classifier parameters, each in R<sup>10</sup> to reach a 95% accuracy
* The neural network uses one hidden layer with 25 elements and achieves 98% accuracy
